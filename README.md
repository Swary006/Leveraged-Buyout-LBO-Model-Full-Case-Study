# 💼 Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model — Full Case Study  
**Date:** May 2025  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project presents a complete **Leveraged Buyout (LBO) model** built from scratch in **Microsoft Excel** to simulate a private equity acquisition scenario over a **5-year investment horizon**. The model demonstrates deal structuring, leverage dynamics, and investor return analysis for a hypothetical transaction.

- **Exit Enterprise Value:** ₹11,274M (at same 10.0x multiple)  
- **Sponsor Equity Value:** ₹8,242M at exit  
- **Returns:** **MOIC 2.8x** and **IRR 23.2%**

## ⚙️ Methodology (Excel Workflow)  
1. Modeled **transaction structure** with sources & uses and entry leverage.  
2. Built **integrated financial statements** (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow).  
3. Created a **detailed debt schedule** covering revolver, term loans, and senior notes.  
4. Implemented an **automatic cash sweep** for debt paydown.  
5. Projected **operating performance** with revenue growth, margin expansion, CapEx, and working capital.  
6. Calculated **IRR, MOIC, and leverage ratios** over time.  
7. Conducted **sensitivity analysis** on exit multiples, holding periods, and revenue growth.  
8. Designed a **dashboard layout** summarizing deal structure, leverage metrics, and return outcomes.
